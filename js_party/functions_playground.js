/* To run the code in this file, run the command:

console.log("functions_playground.js is running")


// Let's start with the examples from the lesson.  

// Lesson Example 1
// Uncomment each function call (invocation) to see what it prints to the console.

function printGreeting(greeting) {
  console.log(greeting)
}

    printGreeting('hi')  
    
    printGreeting('sup')
    
    printGreeting('oh hello there darling!')
    
// Now call the function again yourself, passing through whatever greeting you'd like.  Make sure you pass the greeting as a string (it must be in quotes).
    printGreeting('Howdy')


// Lesson Example 2
// The function below is not printing anything to the console via console.log().  Instead, it is using the 'return' keyword to return a value each time the function is called.  To see the values being returned from the function invocations, we can console.log() the variables that are storing those values. 
//Uncomment the three console.log()s to see the values being stored in each variable.  These console logs have a helpful string to label each one so you can see it easier in the console.

function captureGreeting(greeting) {
  return greeting
}

var hiGreeting = captureGreeting('hi')  

var supGreeting = captureGreeting('sup')

var fancyGreeting = captureGreeting('oh hello there darling!')

console.log('hiGreeting: ', hiGreeting)
console.log('supGreeting: ', supGreeting)
console.log('fancyGreeting: ', fancyGreeting)



// Lesson Example 3
// The function below is doing the exact same thing as the one above. It is just written in the ES6 arrow function syntax.  
// Uncomment the console.log() below to see the value stored in the variable.  

var captureGreetingArrowSyntax = (greeting) => {
  return greeting
}

var helloGreeting = captureGreetingArrowSyntax('hello')  

console.log("helloGreeting: ", helloGreeting)


// NOTE FOR THE EXERCISES BELOW: "print" or "log" both mean to use a console.log()

/*  -- SECTION A: PRACTICING FUNCTIONS STRAIGHT UP -- */
//1A. Make a function called sayName that logs your first name
      function sayName(firstname) { 
        console.log(firstname) }
      var myname = sayName('Seth')

//2A. Edit the sayName function above to create a variable inside of the function that is equal to a greeting. Change the console log to include the greeting concatenated with your name!
      function sayName(firstname) {
        let greeting = "Ohhhh, Hello, "; 
        console.log(greeting + firstname) }
      var myname = sayName('Seth')

//3A. Make a function called watchShow that console logs "I am watching". Then call the logFavoriteMovie function after the console log.
        function watchShow() {
          return 'I am watching '
        }
        
        function logFavoriteMovie(movie) {
          return 'Ikiru'
        }
        console.log(`${watchShow()} ${logFavoriteMovie()}`)

/*  --  SECTION B: FUNCTIONS WITH PARAMETERS. -- */
//1B. Create a function takes in two numbers and logs the numbers added together. Invoke the function two times with different numbers.
        function addnums(num1, num2) {
          let sum = num1 + num2;
          console.log(sum)
        }
        addnums(55, 23)
        addnums(107, 333)

//2B. Create a function that takes in first name and last name and logs a greeting that greets somebody by first and last name. Call the function two times with different names.
        function greet(firstName, lastName) {
          console.log(`Howdy, ${firstName} ${lastName}! We're thrilled to make your acquaintance!`)
        }
        greet("Timmony", "Thompson")
        greet("Greta", "Gringle")

/*  -- SECTION C: FUNCTIONS WITH RETURNS, ARGS and PARAMS -- */
//1C. Make a function that takes in two numbers as arguments and returns the sum of those two numbers. 
// Create a variable called 'total' and assign the variable's value to be an invocation of your function (dont forget to pass in 2 numbers!)  Console log 'total'


//2C. Make a function that takes in the name of a board game and a person's name and returns a string of "Do you want to play (board game name) with (persons name)?". Invoke the function with two different board game titles and names.



//  *** CANT GET ENOUGH FUNCTION PRACTICE??  HERE'S SOME MORE!

// 1D. Create a function called printInfo. This function should take in 3 arguments: `name`, `age` and `hometown`. The function should print a string that states your name, age and hometown using interpolation.


// 2D. Create a function called mathItUp. This function should take two parameters, both being numbers. The function should print the sum of the two numbers. It should also print a string that says `The value of the first parameter is ____ and value of the second parameter is _____.` The function should then return the product of these numbers + 100.
